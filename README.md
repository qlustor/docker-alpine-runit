# Docker: glidelabs/alpine with runit

Docker alpine & runit image built on gliderlabs/alpine Linux micro OS with the final image size of 8 MB vs. 100+ MB compared to the Ubuntu / Debian equivalent. It's intended to be used as a base image for building final app images ready for deployment.

# Running

Pull or build the image yourself and run it. Before you do that you'll need to configure runit and your services ready for "dockerization".
